# Selenium crawler
Old project that aims to do a breadth-first-search of two different hashtags. 
Program will then create a graph based on the results from the two searches, showing how they interlink.
This program was made some time ago, as a result the code is likely deprecated, and is not a good indicator of my current programming abilities.
Nontheless it was a interesting project and I wanted to share it.
